# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that has been archived as it's no longer actively used in development.

## Historical Sprints (`historical-sprints/`)

Contains completed sprint documentation and related files:

- **SPRINT_0_COMPLETE.md** - Sprint 0 completion summary (v0.1.0)
- **SPRINT_1_COMPLETE.md** - Sprint 1 backend completion summary (v0.2.0)
- **SPRINT_1_SCOPE_CHANGE.md** - Decision to defer frontend work to Sprint 2
- **SPRINT_1_TASKS.md** - Sprint 1 task breakdown (superseded by `docs/development/SPRINT_STATUS.md`)
- **PHASE_1_SECURITY_FIXES.md** - Security fixes implemented in Sprint 1
- **CODE_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md** - Response to Sprint 1 code review assessment
- **COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md** - Full codebase audit from Sprint 1

## Proposals & Studies (`historical-sprints/`)

One-off proposal and planning documents:

- **DOCUMENTATION_STRATEGY_PROPOSAL.md** - Proposed documentation architecture (TypeDoc, Sphinx, Docusaurus) - not pursued
- **TASK_2.9_PLAN.md** - Detailed implementation plan for section lock/unlock (completed in Sprint 2)
- **ESLINT_SETUP_SUMMARY.md** - ESLint setup summary (superseded by `docs/development/ESLINT_PRETTIER.md`)

## Why Archive?

These documents are archived because:

1. **Historical sprint summaries** - Preserved for project history but not actively referenced
2. **Completed task details** - Information now consolidated in `docs/development/SPRINT_STATUS.md` and release notes
3. **One-off decisions** - Proposals and assessments that informed architecture but aren't ongoing reference material
4. **Duplicate information** - Content now exists in more authoritative docs (e.g., ESLINT_PRETTIER.md)

## Current Active Documentation
